			<p>In early August, a few weeks before forensic scientists began exhuming dozens of unmarked graves at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, five older black men took a road trip to Marianna, a rural town on the Florida panhandle—historic Klan country—to confront their demons on the reform school’s vast, wooded campus.</p>

			<p>At least 96 children died at Dozier between 1914 and 1973, according to school records, and while state officials say there's no proof, former students insist that some of the deaths were the result  of foul play. Boys were routinely, brutally, and even fatally beaten by staff, they allege; some were raped, and "runners" were fired upon—at least seven kids were reported dead after trying to escape.</p>
			<p>Tens of thousands of boys passed through Dozier's gates between its founding in 1900 and 2011, when Florida officials shut it down (citing budgetary reasons) amid a Justice Department investigation that found ongoing "systemic, egregious, and dangerous practices" at the school.</p>
			<p>At a state hearing in August, after years of agitating by former Dozier boys, researchers from the University of South Florida got permission to unearth bodies from the grounds and run tests to determine who those boys were—and how they died. In January, the scientists made an announcement that was probably not surprising. All the same, it was disturbing. They had excavated the remains of 55 people in a campus graveyard, five more than they had originally identified, and 24 more than were indicated by the school’s official records. And other campus locations remain to be searched. Watch this USF news report on the findings:</p>

			<p>A few days before attending the hearing, the five men returned to Dozier on their own to highlight stories from the "black side." They hadn't seen the place in a half century or so. Photographer Nina Berman accompanied the some of the men into the dilapidated cottages where they’d lived during their time at the school.</p>
